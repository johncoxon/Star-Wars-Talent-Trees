# Star Wars Talent Trees

A repository of resources to help make talent trees in the same style as the excellent trees designed by [Begging for XP]. Unfortunately, the Begging for XP trees aren't available more recently than January 2018. This repo aims to change that by making the resources required to build these trees available to the community.

## Contents of the repo

### Talent boxes

This folder is eps files, generated using Adobe Illustrator, which contain the assets for the various styles of talent boxes. All of these have been grabbed directly from existing Begging for XP talent trees, so they ought to be identical to the existing trees, to maximise compatibility. When making a tree, I open the eps file and copy and paste the objects out of it and into the PDF. I've labelled all the objects so it's clear what's what.

### Talent trees

This folder is PDFs, generated using Adobe Illustrator. If you'd like to create a tree, or edit an existing tree, simply open the PDF in Illustrator or a comparable application and you'll see the various objects. The talent boxes should be top-aligned with the "Row _x_" objects in each PDF, and center-aligned with the "Column _x_ connector" objects in each PDF; this will ensure that the grids are consistent across trees. Unlike Begging for XP, I'm making a single PDF for each talent tree; this helps when using GitHub, but also makes it more convenient for those just looking to grab a single sheet.

## Forking, licensing, and buying T-shirts

I'm slowly making my way through the trees, but if you'd like to help out please fork the repo and make pull requests, or raise issues here on GitHub.
