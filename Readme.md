A repository of resources to help make talent trees in the same style as the excellent trees designed by [Begging for XP]. Unfortunately, the Begging for XP trees aren't available more recently than January 2018. This repo aims to change that by making the resources required to build these trees available to the community.

I'm slowly making my way through the trees, but if you'd like to help out please fork the repo and make pull requests!
